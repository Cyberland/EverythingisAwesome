# Fathers with Toys

Watched a [hilarious video](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1471776339706398/permalink/1506556672895031/) the other night in which two fathers duke it out using random toys that they find laying around a local park. Without uttering a single word, the battle escalates from nerf dart gun war, to car chase, then lightsaber duel, until finally somebody gets punched right into next week.
